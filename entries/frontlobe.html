              <p>   Loss.jpg is a meme where the 4-panel format of a controversial webcomic was copied and imitated in many forms. It is, quite literally, only recognizable because we can understand references and abstract concepts. The frontal lobe is still poorly understood, but we do know that it is necessary for executive functioning. It’s what allows us, as people, to control our own thinking and actions, and make judgements on situations based on our past experiences.
Loss.jpg may not seem like your traditional meme at first. It’s clearly a 4-panel sequence from a webcomic, showing some sort of unfortunate situation for the characters. What is not shown from this scene is the context - A complete 180 shift in tone for this sequence as opposed to the entire rest of the comic, and an artist who dug in his heels to defend the sequence. Communities on the internet picked up on the arguments, and started parodying the format of the strip, with 4-panel sequences. Eventually, the format became so recognizable that to someone who is familiar with the meme, even the minimalist version shown above immediately is visible as a version of the meme, based on past experiences with the meme itself. 
This meme is built on abstraction and memory, and those is possible because of our frontal lobes.

 Now, an individual doesn’t even have to be able to read sheet music to be able to see this as an example of the meme. The pattern can be recognized, and connected to the concept of the meme itself. When assimilating new examples in to an existing series of concepts, we retrieve and construct memories, our prefrontal cortex is consistently activated. (Schater, 1998)

              <p> The Loss.jpg meme needs individuals to be able to make a judgement based on an image, and connect drastically different examples. Even this photograph, based purely on its coloration, has been promoted as an unintentional example of the meme.
