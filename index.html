              <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a meme is “an element of a culture that may be considered to be passed on by non-genetic means, esp. Imitation”. Humans are incredible imitators; this means that we tend to “copy ideas, habits, skills, behaviours, inventions, song and stories” (Rocha 2015). Even from birth, infants learn from observing and imitating the actions from adults (Yale 2007).
Furthermore, memes are a cultural expression. Like viruses, they are pieces of information that pervade a group or society, often spreading rapidly. With the diversity amongst different social groups, different memes affect each individual in a distinct way. Thus, different groups of people have different memes, showing that memes contribute very much to social cohesion. On this website, you will find several examples about how memes affect the brain. Happy memeing!

              <h2 class="display-4">Theory of Mind</h2>
              <p>Theory of mind is the ability of an individual to understand the agency, beliefs, desires, and perspectives of others. It normally develops through childhood, and is related with the development of the frontal lobe. Much of the mechanics behind theory of mind is still not understood, but we do know it is very important for social well being and development. We know that higher levels of autism are related with delayed understanding of theory of mind, sometimes never fully developing. This meme is both an example demonstrating theory of mind, and one that requires a mature theory of mind to understand. The man in the center is ‘checking out’ the women in the red dress, while (presumably) his girlfriend is looking at him with shock. Abstracted away, the modular labels of the meme more demonstrate how these people feel about each other - in this case, the ‘critically acclaimed films’ are shocked, annoyed, and jealous of the ‘me’, referring both to the reader and the creator of the meme, who, instead of watching the critically acclaimed films, is watching bad films, or the women in the red dress. The ‘girlfriend’ is frustrated because she understands that the man is having a desire that she does not want him to have.

 For the viewer, the humor comes from the attaching of theory of mind to more abstract concepts than people. Another example would be the image displayed here since bisexuality is not an agent, but it is given the same attributes as the girl in blue, to explain the relationship between the three concepts in the meme.

              <h2 class="display-4">Social Cognition of Memes: The Nature of Virality</h2>
              <p>Memes are a way of transporting information. Memes can be a normalizing force for societal change, and are often times what entire groups of individuals (teenagers, for example) identify with. Some memes, like Vines, are shorter and contain information that people solely find funny and/or outrageous. More often than not, memes come in the form of viral videos (examples: Rebecca Black’s “Friday” and Big Shaq’s “Man’s Not Hot”), pervading the internet in less than a week to the point where people recognize it instantly and can recite bits from the meme itself in synchrony as a way to reference it (“two plus two is four minus one is three quick maths”). At the core of virality, however, lies the notion of emotional contagion.

Emotional contagion refers to the phenomenon where one individual’s emotion and behavior leads to the triggering of similar behaviors and emotions in others. Emotional contagion arises when you might feel the urge to cry when seeing an actor cry onscreen, or smile when seeing another person smile. When one baby cries in a hospital, this sets off a wave of crying throughout the ward as mirror neurons are activated in the brain, recording facial expressions, body language, and even vocal tones. Emotional contagion is a testament to how humans are natural born imitators, and is the basis of how videos become viral.

When someone shares a video, there are social implications that come with it. By sharing a video, the person chooses to acknowledge that the video that was shared makes them feel a certain way. Emotional contagion is effective because it is a form of psychological contagion, a social influence process conveying that the socially correct response for one is to engage in the same actions (either physical or virtual) of the people around them. In a study, researchers found that people were more likely to spread internet memes if they felt a strong emotional response to the content, disregarding the valency of the response (positive or negative). By seeing someone else share a video, especially if the other person is an ingroup member, individuals are more likely to also share it.

Emotional and psychological contagion not only apply to the spreading of videos; Memes, being vessels that transmit messages, often elicit specific emotions that people feel compelled to share. By sharing memes, a form of social cohesion is established. Because memes transmit information that people deem acceptable to share, this type of information becomes ingrained in the social sphere. Continuous sharing and referencing of memes will eventually shape the beliefs and values of a certain group.
